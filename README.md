Code Quiz Basic JS game

## My Task

My task was to create a gmae in JS that allowes the user to guess the answers of a question and track their score, against a timer of 50 seconds. 

If the user gets a question wrong, it deducts 10 seconds from the timer. 

If the timer runs out, the game stops. 

If you answer all the questions right, you get your score (which is the amount of time left) + it lets you know how many questions you got right.

At the end of the game, you can save your score and start again. You can also clear the high scores.
